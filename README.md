# spotify-player

## Description
This project is currently a work in progress towards developing a functional RFID spotify jukebox via the [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/) Python library to interface with the Spotify web application. This Github repository will contain the steps towards creating a functional spotify application as well as containing links to the thingiverse repository of the .stl files to 3D print if needed.
